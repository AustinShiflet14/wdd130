            <p> Hey my name is Austin Shiflet, I curently live in South Jordan, Utah, but I grew up in Arizona. I lived there my whole life except for my mission, and the reason I moved was because I got married to my beautiful wife. I love cars and sports, especially basketball and volleyball. I love learning new things and aquiring new skills.</p>
